# Escola do Futuro

![escoladofuturo](/public/images/teacher-students.jpg)

This is an application built within Ironhack's Web Development Bootcamp. For module 2's project, I build a school management system app, where three different type of users can access pertinent data:

- Teachers
- Students
- Parents

## The App

Please proceed to [Escola do Futuro](https://escola-do-futuro.herokuapp.com/) to use the app. It's built so only pre-cleared users have their credentials set. You can request access and soon you'll get an email with your temporary password.

The app only supports Portuguese, as it is targeted at Brazilian audiences.

## Use Cases

The application was built having all the different stakeholders at a school in mind.

- For teachers, it should be a place to centralize all student and course information.
- For students, it should be a place where they can check their grades, classes time schedules and different career resources to explore.
- For parents, it should be a place to monitor their children's performance and overall engagement with the school.
